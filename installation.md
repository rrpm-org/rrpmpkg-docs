# Installation

If you have installed RRPM version 1.2.0 or above, you most like already have RRPMPkg installed. You can check if it is installed or not using `rrpmpkg version`.

If you have RRPM version 1.1.0 or lower or you don't have it installed, you can install it manually from PyPI as shown below

```python
pip install rrpmpkg
```
